    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>This SRFI specifies an array mechanism for Scheme. Arrays as defined here are quite general; at their most basic, an array is simply a mapping, or function, from multi-indices of exact integers $i_0,\ldots,i_{d-1}$ to Scheme values.  The set of multi-indices $i_0,\ldots,i_{d-1}$ that are valid for a given array form the <i>domain</i> of the array.  In this SRFI, each array's domain consists  of the cross product of nonempty intervals of exact integers $[l_0,u_0)\times[l_1,u_1)\times\cdots\times[l_{d-1},u_{d-1})$ of $\mathbb Z^d$, $d$-tuples of integers.  Thus, we introduce a data type called $d$-<i>intervals</i>, or more briefly <i>intervals</i>, that encapsulates this notion. (We borrow this terminology from, e.g.,  Elias Zakon's <a href="http://www.trillia.com/zakon1.html">Basic Concepts of Mathematics</a>.) Specialized variants of arrays are specified to provide portable programs with efficient representations for common use cases.</p>
    <h2>Rationale</h2>
    <p>This SRFI was motivated by a number of somewhat independent notions, which we outline here and which are explained below.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide a <b>general API</b> (Application Program Interface) that specifies the minimal required properties of any given array, without requiring any specific implementation strategy from the programmer for that array.</li>
      <li>Provide a <b>single, efficient implementation for dense arrays</b> (which we call <i>specialized arrays</i>).</li>
      <li>Provide <b>useful array transformations</b> by exploiting the algebraic structure of affine one-to-one mappings on multi-indices.</li>
      <li>Separate <b>the routines that specify the work to be done</b> (<code>array-map</code>, <code>array-outer-product</code>, etc.) from <b>the routines that actually do the work</b> (<code>array-copy</code>, <code>array-assign!</code>, <code>array-fold</code>, etc.). This approach <b>avoids temporary intermediate arrays</b> in computations.</li>
      <li>Encourage <b>bulk processing of arrays</b> rather than word-by-word operations.</li></ul>
    <p>This SRFI differs from the finalized <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-122/">SRFI 122</a> in the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The procedures <code>specialized-array-default-mutable?</code>, <code>interval-for-each</code>, <code>interval-cartesian-product</code>, <code>interval-rotate</code> and <code>array-elements-in-order?</code>, <code>array-outer-product</code>, <code>array-tile</code>, <code>array-rotate</code>, <code>array-reduce</code>, <code>array-assign!</code>, <code>array-ref</code>, <code>array-set!</code>, and <code>specialized-array-reshape</code> have been added together with some examples.</li>
      <li>Global variables <code>f8-storage-class</code> and <code>f16-storage-class</code> have been added.</li>
      <li>Homogeneous storage classes must be implemented using homogeneous vectors, or be defined as <code>#f</code>.</li>
      <li>The procedure <code>make-interval</code> now takes one or two arguments.</li>
      <li>Specialized arrays can be mutable or immutable; the default, which can be changed, is mutable. Shared arrays inherit safety and mutability from source arrays.</li>
      <li>The discussion of Haar transforms as examples of separable transforms has been corrected.</li>
      <li>The documentation has a few more examples of image processing algorithms.</li>
      <li>Some matrix examples have been added to this document.</li></ul>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Bawden-style arrays</h3>
    <p>In a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!msg/comp.lang.scheme/7nkx58Kv6RI/a5hdsduFL2wJ">1993 post</a> to the news group comp.lang.scheme, Alan Bawden gave a simple implementation of multi-dimensional arrays in R4RS scheme. The only constructor of new arrays required specifying an initial value, and he provided the three low-level primitives <code>array-ref</code>, <code>array-set!</code>, and <code>array?</code>, as well as <code>make-array</code> and <code>make-shared-array</code>.  His arrays were defined on rectangular intervals in $\mathbb Z^d$ of the form $[l_0,u_0)\times\cdots\times [l_{d-1},u_{d-1})$.  I'll note that his function <code>array-set!</code> put the value to be entered into the array at the front of the variable-length list of indices that indicate where to place the new value.  He offered an intriguing way to &quot;share&quot; arrays in the form of a routine <code>make-shared-array</code> that took a mapping from a new interval of indices into the domain of the array to be shared.  His implementation incorporated what he called an <i>indexer</i>, which was a function from the interval $[l_0,u_0)\times\cdots\times [l_{d-1},u_{d-1})$ to an interval $[0,N)$, where the <i>body</i> of the array consisted of a single Scheme vector of length $N$.  Bawden called the mapping specified in <code>make-shared-array</code> <i>linear</i>, but I prefer the term <i>affine</i>, as I explain later.</p>
    <p>Mathematically, Bawden's arrays can be described as follows.  We'll use the vector notation $\vec i$ for a multi-index $i_0,\ldots,i_{d-1}$. (Multi-indices correspond to Scheme <code>values</code>.)  Arrays will be denoted by capital letters $A,B,\ldots$, the domain of the array $A$ will be denoted by $D_A$, and the indexer of $A$, mapping $D_A$ to the interval $[0,N)$, will be denoted by $I_A$.  Initially, Bawden constructs $I_A$ such that $I_A(\vec i)$ steps consecutively through the values $0,1,\ldots,N-1$ as $\vec i$ steps through the multi-indices $(l_0,\ldots,l_{d-2},l_{d-1})$, $(l_0,\ldots,l_{d-2},l_{d-1}+1)$, $\ldots$, $(l_0,\ldots,l_{d-2}+1,l_{d-1})$, etc., in lexicographical order, which means that if $\vec i$ and $\vec j$ are two multi-indices, then $\vec i&lt;\vec j$ iff the first coordinate $k$ where $\vec i$ and $\vec j$ differ satisfies $\vec i_k&lt;\vec j_k$.</p>
    <p>In <code>make-shared-array</code>, Bawden allows you to specify a new $r$-dimensional interval $D_B$ as the domain of a new array $B$, and a mapping $T_{BA}:D_B\to D_A$ of the form $T_{BA}(\vec i)=M\vec i+\vec b$; here $M$ is a $d\times r$ matrix of integer values and $\vec b$ is a $d$-vector.  So this mapping $T_{BA}$ is <i>affine</i>, in that $T_{BA}(\vec i)-T_{BA}(\vec j)=M(\vec i-\vec j)$ is <i>linear</i> (in a linear algebra sense) in $\vec i-\vec j$.  The new indexer of $B$ satisfies $I_B(\vec i)=I_A(T_{BA}(\vec i))$.</p>
    <p>A fact Bawden exploits in the code, but doesn't point out in the short post, is that $I_B$ is again an affine map, and indeed, the composition of <i>any</i> two affine maps is again affine.</p>
    <h3>Our extensions of Bawden-style arrays</h3>
    <p>We incorporate Bawden-style arrays into this SRFI, but extend them in one minor way that we find useful.</p>
    <p>We introduce the notion of a <i>storage class</i>, an object that contains functions that manipulate, store, check, etc., different types of values. A <code>generic-storage-class</code> can manipulate any Scheme value, whereas, e.g., a <code>u1-storage-class</code> can store only the values 0 and 1 in each element of a body.</p>
    <p>We also require that our affine maps be one-to-one, so that if $\vec i\neq\vec j$ then $T(\vec i)\neq T(\vec j)$.  Without this property, modifying the $\vec i$th component of $A$ would cause the $\vec j$th component to change.</p>
    <h3>Common transformations on Bawden-style arrays</h3>
    <p>Requiring the transformations $T_{BA}:D_B\to D_A$ to be affine may seem  esoteric and restricting, but in fact many common and useful array transformations can be expressed in this way.  We give several examples below: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Restricting the domain of an array: </b>  If the domain of $B$, $D_B$, is a subset of the domain of $A$, then $T_{BA}(\vec i)=\vec i$ is a one-to-one affine mapping.  We define <code>array-extract</code> to define this common operation; it's like looking at a rectangular sub-part of a spreadsheet. We use it to extract the common part of overlapping domains of three arrays in an image processing example below. </li>
      <li><b>Tiling an array: </b>For various reasons (parallel processing, optimizing cache localization, GPU programming, etc.) one may wish to process a large array as a number of subarrays of the same dimensions, which we call <i>tiling</i> the array.  The routine <code>array-tile</code> returns a new array, each entry of which is a subarray extracted (in the sense of <code>array-extract</code>) from the input array.</li>
      <li><b>Translating the domain of an array: </b>If $\vec d$ is a vector of integers, then $T_{BA}(\vec i)=\vec i-\vec d$ is a one-to-one affine map of $D_B=\{\vec i+\vec d\mid \vec i\in D_A\}$ onto $D_A$. We call $D_B$ the <i>translate</i> of $D_A$, and we define <code>array-translate</code> to provide this operation.</li>
      <li><b>Permuting the coordinates of an array: </b>If $\pi$ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation">permutes</a> the coordinates of a multi-index $\vec i$, and $\pi^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\pi$, then $T_{BA}(\vec i)=\pi (\vec i)$ is a one-to-one affine map from $D_B=\{\pi^{-1}(\vec i)\mid \vec i\in D_A\}$ onto $D_A$.  We provide <code>array-permute</code> for this operation. (The only nonidentity permutation of a two-dimensional spreadsheet turns rows into columns and vice versa.) We also provide <code>array-rotate</code> for the special permutations that rotate the axes. For example, in three dimensions we have the following three rotations: $i\ j\ k\to j\ k\ i$; $i\ j\ k\to k\ i\ j$; and the trivial (identity) rotation $i\ j\ k\to i\ j\ k$.  The three-dimensional permutations that are not rotations are $i\ j\ k\to i\ k\ j$; $i\ j\ k\to j\ i\ k$; and $i\ j\ k\to k\ j\ i$.</li>
      <li><b>Currying an array: </b>Let's denote the cross product of two intervals $\text{Int}_1$ and $\text{Int}_2$ by $\text{Int}_1\times\text{Int}_2$; if $\vec j=(j_0,\ldots,j_{r-1})\in \text{Int}_1$ and $\vec i=(i_0,\ldots,i_{s-1})\in \text{Int}_2$, then $\vec j\times\vec i$, which we define to be $(j_0,\ldots,j_{r-1},i_0,\ldots,i_{s-1})$, is in $\text{Int}_1\times\text{Int}_2$. If $D_A=\text{Int}_1\times\text{Int}_2$ and $\vec j\in\text{Int}_1$, then $T_{BA}(\vec i)=\vec j\times\vec i$ is a one-to-one affine mapping from $D_B=\text{Int}_2$ into $D_A$.  For each vector $\vec j$ we can compute a new array in this way; we provide <code>array-curry</code> for this operation, which returns an array whose domain is $\text{Int}_1$ and whose elements are themselves arrays, each of which is defined on $\text{Int}_2$. Currying a two-dimensional array would be like organizing a spreadsheet into a one-dimensional array of rows of the spreadsheet.</li>
      <li><b>Traversing some indices in a multi-index in reverse order: </b>Consider an array $A$ with domain $D_A=[l_0,u_0)\times\cdots\times[l_{d-1},u_{d-1})$. Fix $D_B=D_A$ and assume we're given a vector of booleans $F$ ($F$ for &quot;flip?&quot;). Then define $T_{BA}:D_B\to D_A$ by $i_j\to i_j$ if $F_j$ is <code>#f</code> and $i_j\to u_j+l_j-1-i_j$ if  $F_j$ is <code>#t</code>. In other words,  we reverse the ordering of the $j$th coordinate of $\vec i$ if and only if $F_j$ is true. $T_{BA}$ is an affine mapping from $D_B\to D_A$, which defines a new array $B$, and we can provide <code>array-reverse</code> for this operation. Applying <code>array-reverse</code> to a two-dimensional spreadsheet might reverse the order of the rows or columns (or both).</li>
      <li><b>Uniformly sampling an array: </b>Assume that $A$ is an array with domain $[0,u_1)\times\cdots\times[0,u_{d-1})$ (i.e., an interval all of whose lower bounds are zero). We'll also assume the existence of vector $S$ of scale factors, which are positive exact integers. Let $D_B$ be a new interval with $j$th lower bound equal to zero and $j$th upper bound equal to $\operatorname{ceiling}(u_j/S_j)$ and let $T_{BA}(\vec i)_j=i_j\times S_j$, i.e., the $j$th coordinate is scaled by $S_j$.  ($D_B$ contains precisely those multi-indices that $T_{BA}$ maps into $D_A$.) Then $T_{BA}$ is an affine one-to-one mapping, and we provide <code>interval-scale</code> and <code>array-sample</code> for these operations.</li></ul>
    <p>We make several remarks.  First, all these operations could have been computed by specifying the particular mapping $T_{BA}$ explicitly, so that these routines are simply &quot;convenience&quot; procedures.  Second, because the composition of any number of affine mappings is again affine, accessing or changing the elements of a restricted, translated, curried, permuted array is no slower than accessing or changing the elements of the original array itself. Finally, we note that by combining array currying and permuting, say, one can come up with simple expressions of powerful algorithms, such as extending one-dimensional transforms to multi-dimensional separable transforms, or quickly generating two-dimensional slices of three-dimensional image data. Examples are given below.</p>
    <h3>Generalized arrays</h3>
    <p>Bawden-style arrays are clearly useful as a programming construct, but they do not fulfill all our needs in this area. An array, as commonly understood, provides a mapping from multi-indices  $(i_0,\ldots,i_{d-1})$ of exact integers
      in a nonempty, rectangular, $d$-dimensional interval $[l_0,u_0)\times[l_1,u_1)\times\cdots\times[l_{d-1},u_{d-1})$ (the <i>domain</i> of the array) to Scheme objects.
      Thus, two things are necessary to specify an array: an interval and a mapping that has that interval as its domain.</p>
    <p>Since these two things are often sufficient for certain algorithms, we introduce in this SRFI a minimal set of interfaces for dealing with such arrays.</p>
    <p>Specifically, an array specifies a nonempty, multi-dimensional interval, called its <i>domain</i>, and a mapping from this domain to Scheme objects.  This mapping is called the <i>getter</i> of the array, accessed with the procedure <code>array-getter</code>; the domain of the array (more precisely, the domain of the array's getter) is accessed with the procedure <code>array-domain</code>.</p>
    <p>If this mapping can be changed, the array is said to be <i>mutable</i> and the mutation is effected
      by the array's <i>setter</i>, accessed by the procedure <code>array-setter</code>.  We call an object of this type a mutable array. Note: If an array does not have a setter, then we call it immutable even though the array's getter might not be a &quot;pure&quot; function, i.e., the value it returns may not depend solely on the arguments passed to the getter.</p>
    <p>In general, we leave the implementation of generalized arrays completely open.  They may be defined simply by closures, or
      they may have hash tables or databases behind an implementation, one may read the values from a file, etc.</p>
    <p>In this SRFI, Bawden-style arrays are called <i>specialized</i>. A specialized array is an example of a mutable array.</p>
    <h3>Sharing generalized arrays</h3>
    <p>Even if an array $A$ is not a specialized array, then it could be &quot;shared&quot; by specifying a new interval $D_B$ as the domain of a new array $B$ and an affine map $T_{BA}:D_B\to D_A$.  Each call to $B$ would then be computed as $B(\vec i)=A(T_{BA}(\vec i))$.</p>
    <p>One could again &quot;share&quot; $B$, given a new interval $D_C$ as the domain of a new array $C$ and an affine transform $T_{CB}:D_C\to D_B$, and then each access $C(\vec i)=A(T_{BA}(T_{CB}(\vec i)))$.  The composition $T_{BA}\circ T_{CB}:D_C\to D_A$, being itself affine, could be precomputed and stored as $T_{CA}:D_C\to D_A$, and $C(\vec i)=A(T_{CA}(\vec i))$ can be computed with the overhead of computing a single affine transformation.</p>
    <p>So, if we wanted, we could share generalized arrays with constant overhead by adding a single layer of (multi-valued) affine transformations on top of evaluating generalized arrays.  Even though this could be done transparently to the user, we do not do that here; it would be a compatible extension of this SRFI to do so.  We provide only the routine <code>specialized-array-share</code>, not a more general <code>array-share</code>.</p>
    <p>Certain ways of sharing generalized arrays, however, are relatively easy to code and not that expensive.  If we denote <code>(array-getter A)</code> by <code>A-getter</code>, then if B is the result of <code>array-extract</code> applied to A, then <code>(array-getter B)</code> is simply <code>A-getter</code>.  Similarly, if A is a two-dimensional array, and B is derived from A by applying the permutation $\pi((i,j))=(j,i)$, then <code>(array-getter B)</code> is <code>(lambda (i j) (A-getter j i))</code>.  Translation and currying also lead to transformed arrays whose getters are relatively efficiently derived from <code>A-getter</code>, at least for arrays of small dimension.</p>
    <p>Thus, while we do not provide for sharing of generalized arrays for general one-to-one affine maps $T$, we do allow it for the specific functions <code>array-extract</code>, <code>array-translate</code>, <code>array-permute</code>,  <code>array-curry</code>,  <code>array-reverse</code>, <code>array-tile</code>, <code>array-rotate</code> and <code>array-sample</code>,  and we provide relatively efficient implementations of these functions for arrays of dimension no greater than four.</p>
    <h3>Array-map does not produce a specialized array</h3>
    <p>Daniel Friedman and David Wise wrote a famous paper <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/cgi-bin/techreports/TRNNN.cgi?trnum=TR44">CONS should not Evaluate its Arguments</a>. In the spirit of that paper, our procedure <code>array-map</code> does not immediately produce a specialized array, but a simple immutable array, whose elements are recomputed from the arguments of <code>array-map</code> each time they are accessed.   This immutable array can be passed on to further applications of <code>array-map</code> for further processing without generating the storage bodies for intermediate arrays.</p>
    <p>We provide the procedure <code>array-copy</code> to transform a generalized array (like that returned by <code>array-map</code>) to a specialized, Bawden-style array, for which accessing each element again takes $O(1)$ operations.</p>
    <h3>Notational convention</h3>
    <p>If <code><var>A</var></code> is an array, then we generally define <code><var>A_</var></code> to be <code>(array-getter <var>A</var>)</code> and  <code><var>A!</var></code> to be <code>(array-setter <var>A</var>)</code>.  The latter notation is motivated by the general Scheme convention that the names of functions that modify the contents of data structures end in <code><var>!</var></code>, while the notation for the getter of an array is motivated by the TeX notation for subscripts.  See particularly the <a href="#Haar">Haar transform</a> example.</p>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Relationship to <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/math/array_nonstrict.html#%28tech._nonstrict%29">nonstrict arrays</a> in Racket. </b>It appears that what we call simply arrays in this SRFI are called nonstrict arrays in the math/array library of Racket, which in turn was influenced by an <a href="https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/ndp/RArrays.pdf">array proposal for Haskell</a>.  Our &quot;specialized&quot; arrays are related to Racket's &quot;strict&quot; arrays.</li>
      <li><b>Indexers. </b>The argument <var>new-domain-&gt;old-domain</var> to <code>specialized-array-share</code> is, conceptually, a multi-valued array.</li>
      <li><b>Source of function names. </b>The function <code>array-curry</code> gets its name from the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying">curry operator</a> in programming &mdash; we are currying the getter of the array and keeping careful track of the domains.
        <code>interval-projections</code> can be thought of as currying the
        characteristic function of the interval,  encapsulated here as <code>interval-contains-multi-index?</code>.</li>
      <li><b>Choice of functions on intervals. </b>The choice of functions for both arrays and intervals was motivated almost solely by what I needed for arrays.</li>
      <li><b>No empty intervals. </b>This SRFI considers arrays over only nonempty intervals of positive dimension.  The author of this proposal acknowledges that other languages and array systems allow either zero-dimensional intervals or empty intervals of positive dimension, but prefers to leave such empty intervals as possibly compatible extensions to the current proposal.</li>
      <li><b>Multi-valued arrays. </b>While this SRFI restricts attention to single-valued arrays, wherein the getter of each array returns a single value, allowing multi-valued immutable arrays would be a compatible extension of this SRFI.</li>
      <li><b>No low-level specialized array constructor. </b>While the author of the SRFI uses mainly <code>(make-array ...)</code>, <code>array-map</code>, and <code>array-copy</code> to construct arrays, and while there are several other ways to construct arrays, there is no really low-level interface given for constructing specialized arrays (where one specifies a body, an indexer, etc.).  It was felt that certain difficulties, some surmountable (such as checking that a given body is compatible with a given storage class) and some not (such as checking that an indexer is indeed affine), made a low-level interface less useful.  At the same time, the simple <code>(make-array ...)</code> mechanism is so general, allowing one to specify getters and setters as general functions, as to cover nearly all needs.</li></ul>

    <h2>Miscellaneous Functions</h2>
    <p>This document refers to <i>translations</i> and <i>permutations</i>.
       A translation is a vector of exact integers.  A permutation of dimension $n$
      is a vector whose entries are the exact integers $0,1,\ldots,n-1$, each occurring once, in any order.</p>
    <h3>Procedures</h3>
    <p><b>Procedure: </b><code><a id="translation?">translation?</a> <var>object</var></code></p>
    <p>Returns <code>#t</code> if <code><var>object</var></code> is a translation, and <code>#f</code> otherwise.</p>
    <p><b>Procedure: </b><code><a id="permutation?">permutation?</a> <var>object</var></code></p>
    <p>Returns <code>#t</code> if <code><var>object</var></code> is a permutation, and <code>#f</code> otherwise.</p>
    <h2>Intervals</h2>
    <p>An interval represents the set of all multi-indices of exact integers
      $i_0,\ldots,i_{d-1}$
      satisfying
      $l_0\leq i_0&lt;u_0,\ldots,l_{d-1}\leq i_{d-1}&lt;u_{d-1}$,
      where the <i>lower bounds</i>
      $l_0,\ldots,l_{d-1}$
      and the <i>upper bounds</i>
      $u_0,\ldots,u_{d-1}$
      are specified multi-indices of exact integers.  The positive integer $d$ is the <i>dimension</i>
      of the interval.  It is required that
      $l_0&lt;u_0,\ldots,l_{d-1}&lt;u_{d-1}$.</p>
    <p>Intervals are a data type distinct from other Scheme data types.</p>

    <p><b>Procedure: </b><code><a id="interval-translate">interval-translate</a> <var>interval</var> <var>translation</var></code></p>

      upper bounds $u_0+T_0,\dots,u_{d-1}+T_{d-1}$.
      It is an error if the arguments do not satisfy these conditions.</p>
    <p>One could define <code>(interval-translate interval translation)</code> by <code>(interval-dilate interval translation translation)</code>.</p>
    <p><b>Procedure: </b><code><a id="interval-permute">interval-permute</a> <var>interval</var> <var>permutation</var></code></p>
    <p>The argument <code><var>interval</var></code> must be an interval, and the argument <code><var>permutation</var></code> must be a valid permutation with the same dimension as <code><var>interval</var></code>.  It is an error if the arguments do not satisfy these conditions.</p>
    <p>Heuristically, this function returns a new interval whose axes have been permuted in a way consistent with <code><var>permutation</var></code>.
      But we have to say how the entries of <code><var>permutation</var></code> are associated with the new interval.</p>
    <p>We have chosen the following convention: If the permutation is $(\pi_0,\ldots,\pi_{d-1})$, and the argument interval
      represents the cross product
      $[l_0,u_0)\times[l_1,u_1)\times\cdots\times[l_{d-1},u_{d-1})$,
      then the result represents the cross product
      $[l_{\pi_0},u_{\pi_0})\times[l_{\pi_1},u_{\pi_1})\times\cdots\times[l_{\pi_{d-1}},u_{\pi_{d-1}})$.</p>
    <p>For example, if the argument interval represents $[0,4)\times[0,8)\times[0,21)\times [0,16)$ and the
      permutation is <code>#(3 0 1 2)</code>, then the result of <code>(interval-permute <var>interval</var> <var>permutation</var>)</code> will be
      the representation of $[0,16)\times [0,4)\times[0,8)\times[0,21)$.</p>

    <p>More precisely, <code>(interval-rotate <var>interval</var> <var>dim</var>)</code> assumes that <code><var>interval</var></code> is an interval and <code><var>dim</var></code> is an exact integer between 0 (inclusive) and <code>(interval-dimension <var>interval</var>)</code> (exclusive).

    <h2>Storage classes</h2>
    <p>Conceptually, a storage-class is a set of functions to manage the backing store of a specialized array.
      The functions allow one to make a backing store, to get values from the store and to set new values, to return the length of the store, and to specify a default value for initial elements of the backing store.  Typically, a backing store is a (heterogeneous or homogeneous) vector.  A storage-class has a type distinct from other Scheme types.</p>
    <h3>Procedures</h3>

    <p>Here we assume the following relationships between the arguments of <code>make-storage-class</code>.  Assume that the &quot;elements&quot; of
      the backing store are of some &quot;type&quot;, either heterogeneous (all Scheme types) or homogeneous (of some restricted type).</p>

    <p>If <code><var>interval</var></code> is an interval and <code><var>getter</var></code> is a function from

    <p>Assume that <code><var>A</var></code> is an array and <code><var>S</var></code> is a vector of positive, exact integers.  The routine <code>array-tile</code> returns a new immutable array $T$, each entry of which is a subarray of <code>A</code> whose domain has sidelengths given (mostly) by the entries of <code><var>S</var></code>.  These subarrays completely &quot;tile&quot; <code><var>A</var></code>, in the sense that every entry in <code><var>A</var></code> is an entry of precisely one entry of the result $T$.</p>
    <p>More formally, if <code><var>S</var></code> is the vector $(s_0,\ldots,s_{d-1})$, and the domain of <code><var>A</var></code> is the interval $[l_0,u_0)\times\cdots\times [l_{d-1},u_{d-1})$, then $T$ is an immutable array with all lower bounds zero and upper bounds given by
      $$
      \operatorname{ceiling}((u_0-l_0)/s_0),\ldots,\operatorname{ceiling}((u_{d-1}-l_{d-1})/s_{d-1}).

      The $i_0,\ldots,i_{d-1}$ entry of $T$ is <code>(array-extract <var>A</var> D_i)</code> with the interval <code>D_i</code> given by

      (The &quot;minimum&quot; operators are necessary if $u_j-l_j$ is not divisible by $s_j$.) Thus, each entry of $T$ will be a specialized, mutable, or immutable array, depending on the type of the input array <code><var>A</var></code>.</p>

    <p><b>Procedure: </b><code><a id="array-permute">array-permute</a> <var>array</var> <var>permutation</var></code></p>
    <p>Assumes that <code><var>array</var></code> is a valid array, <code><var>permutation</var></code> is a valid permutation, and that the dimensions of the array and the permutation are the same. The resulting array will have domain <code>(interval-permute (array-domain array) permutation)</code>.</p>
    <p>We begin with an example.  Assume that the domain of <code><var>array</var></code> is represented by the interval  $[0,4)\times[0,8)\times[0,21)\times [0,16)$, as in the example for <code>interval-permute</code>, and the permutation is <code>#(3 0 1 2)</code>.  Then the domain of the new array is the interval $[0,16)\times [0,4)\times[0,8)\times[0,21)$.</p>
    <p>So the multi-index argument of the <code>getter</code> of the result of <code>array-permute</code> must lie in the new domain of the array, the interval  $[0,16)\times [0,4)\times[0,8)\times[0,21)$.  So if we define <code><var>old-getter</var></code> as <code>(array-getter <var>array</var>)</code>, the definition of the new array must be in fact</p>
    <pre><code>
(make-array (interval-permute (array-domain <var>array</var>)
                              '#(3 0 1 2))
            (lambda (l i j k)
              (old-getter i j k l)))
</code></pre>
    <p>So you see that if the first argument if the new getter is in $[0,16)$, then indeed the fourth argument of <code><var>old-getter</var></code> is also in $[0,16)$, as it should be. This is a subtlety that I don't see how to overcome.  It is the listing of the arguments of the new getter, the <code>lambda</code>, that must be permuted.</p>
    <p>Mathematically, we can define $\pi^{-1}$, the inverse of a permutation $\pi$, such that $\pi^{-1}$ composed with $\pi$ gives the identity permutation.  Then the getter of the new array is, in pseudo-code, <code>(lambda multi-index (apply <var>old-getter</var> (</code>$\pi^{-1}$<code> multi-index)))</code>.  We have assumed that $\pi^{-1}$ takes a list as an argument and returns a list as a result.</p>
    <p>Employing this same pseudo-code, if <code><var>array</var></code> is a specialized array and we denote the permutation by $\pi$, then <code>array-permute</code> returns the new specialized array</p>
    <pre><code>
(specialized-array-share <var>array</var>
                         (interval-permute (array-domain <var>array</var>) &pi;)
                         (lambda multi-index
                           (apply values (&pi;<sup>-1</sup> multi-index))))</code></pre>
    <p>The resulting array shares the body of <code><var>array</var></code>, as well as its safety and mutability.</p>
    <p>Again employing this same pseudo-code, if <code><var>array</var></code> is not a specialized array, but is
      a mutable-array, then <code>array-permute</code> returns the new mutable</p>
    <pre><code>
(make-array (interval-permute (array-domain <var>array</var>) &pi;)
            (lambda multi-index
              (apply (array-getter <var>array</var>)
                     (&pi;<sup>-1</sup> multi-index)))

                     (&pi;<sup>-1</sup> multi-index))))</code></pre>
    <p>which employs the setter and the getter of the argument to <code>array-permute</code>.</p>
    <p>Finally, if <code><var>array</var></code> is not a mutable array, then <code>array-permute</code> returns</p>
    <pre><code>

    <p><b>Procedure: </b><code><a id="array-reverse">array-reverse</a> <var>array</var> #!optional <var>flip?</var></code></p>

If <code><var>flip?</var></code> is not given, it is set to a vector with length the same as the dimension of <code><var>array</var></code>, all of whose elements are <code>#t</code>.</p>
    <p><code>array-reverse</code> returns a new array  that is specialized,  mutable, or immutable according to whether <code><var>array</var></code> is specialized, mutable, or immutable, respectively.  Informally, if <code>(vector-ref <var>flip?</var> k)</code> is true, then the ordering of multi-indices in the k'th coordinate direction is reversed, and is left undisturbed otherwise.</p>

    <p>It is an error if <code><var>A</var></code> is not a mutable array, if <code>v</code> is not an appropriate value to be stored in that array, or if the number of arguments specified is not the correct number for <code>(array-setter <var>A</var>)</code>.</p>
    <p><b>Note: </b>In the sample implementation, because <code>array-ref</code> and <code>array-set!</code> take a variable number of arguments and they must check that <code><var>A</var></code> is an array of the appropriate type, programs written in a style using these functions, rather than the style in which <code>1D-Haar-loop</code> is coded below, can take up to three times as long runtime.</p>
    <p><b>Note: </b>In the sample implementation, checking whether the multi-indices are exact integers and within the domain of the array, and checking whether the value is appropriate for storage into the array, is delegated to the underlying definition of the array argument.  If the first argument is a safe specialized array, then these items are checked; if it is an unsafe specialized array, they are not.  If it is a generalized array, it is up to the programmer whether to define the getter and setter of the array to check the correctness of the arguments.</p>
    <p><b>Procedure: </b><code><a id="specialized-array-reshape">specialized-array-reshape</a> <var>array</var> <var>new-domain</var> [ <var>copy-on-failure?</var> #f ]</code></p>
    <p>Assumes that <code><var>array</var></code> is a specialized array, <code><var>new-domain</var></code> is an interval with the same volume as <code>(array-domain <var>array</var>)</code>, and <code><var>copy-on-failure?</var></code>, if given, is a boolean.</p>
    <p>If there is an affine map that takes the multi-indices in <code><var>new-domain</var></code> to the cells in <code>(array-body <var>array</var>)</code> storing the elements of <code><var>array</var></code> in lexicographical order, returns a new specialized array, with the same body and elements as <code><var>array</var></code> and domain <code><var>new-domain</var></code>.  The result inherits its mutability and safety from <code><var>array</var></code>.</p>
    <p>If there is not an affine map that takes the multi-indices in <code><var>new-domain</var></code> to the cells storing the elements of <code><var>array</var></code> in lexicographical order and <code><var>copy-on-failure?</var></code> is <code>#t</code>, then returns a specialized array copy of <code><var>array</var></code> with domain <code><var>new-domain</var></code>, storage class <code>(array-storage-class <var>array</var>)</code>, mutability <code>(mutable-array? <var>array</var>)</code>, and safety <code>(array-safe? <var>array</var>)</code>.</p>
    <p>It is an error if these conditions on the arguments are not met.</p>
    <p><b>Note: </b>The code in the sample implementation to determine whether there exists an affine map from <code><var>new-domain</var></code> to the multi-indices of the elements of <code><var>array</var></code> in lexicographical order is modeled on the corresponding code in the Python library NumPy.</p>
    <p><b>Note: </b>In the sample implementation, if an array cannot be reshaped and <code><var>copy-on-failure?</var></code> is <code>#f</code>, an error is raised in tail position.  An implementation might want to replace this error call with a continuable exception to give the programmer more flexibility.</p>
    <p><b>Examples: </b>Reshaping an array is not a Bawden-type array transform.  For example, we use <code>array-display</code> defined below to see:</p>

    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    <p>We provide an implementation in <a href="https://github.com/gambit/gambit">Gambit Scheme</a>; the nonstandard techniques used
      in the implementation are: DSSSL-style optional and keyword arguments; a
      unique object to indicate absent arguments; <code>define-structure</code>;
      and <code>define-macro</code>.</p>
    <p>There is a <a href="https://github.com/scheme-requests-for-implementation/srfi-179">git repository</a> of this document, a sample implementation, a test file, and other materials.</p>
    <h2>Relationship to other SRFIs</h2>
    <p>Final SRFIs <a href="#SRFI-25">25</a>, <a href="#SRFI-47">47</a>, <a href="#SRFI-58">58</a>, and <a href="#SRFI-63">63</a> deal with &quot;Multi-dimensional Array Primitives&quot;, &quot;Array&quot;, &quot;Array Notation&quot;,
      and &quot;Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Arrays&quot;, respectively.  Each of these previous SRFIs deal with what we call in this SRFI
      specialized arrays.  Many of the functions in these previous SRFIs  have corresponding forms in this SRFI.  For example, from <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-63/">SRFI 63</a>, we can
      translate: </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><code>(array? obj)</code></dt>
      <dd><code>(array? obj)</code></dd>
      <dt><code>(array-rank A)</code></dt>
      <dd><code>(array-dimension A)</code></dd>
      <dt><code>(make-array prototype k1 ...)</code></dt>
      <dd><code>(make-specialized-array (make-interval (vector k1 ...)) storage-class)</code>.</dd>
      <dt><code>(make-shared-array A mapper k1 ...)</code></dt>
      <dd><code>(specialized-array-share A (make-interval (vector k1 ...)) mapper)</code></dd>
      <dt><code>(array-in-bounds? A index1 ...)</code></dt>
      <dd><code>(interval-contains-multi-index? (array-domain A) index1 ...)</code></dd>
      <dt><code>(array-ref A k1 ...)</code></dt>
      <dd><code>(let ((A_ (array-getter A))) ... (A_ k1 ...) ... )</code> or <code>(array-ref A k1 ...)</code></dd>

      <dd><code>(let ((A! (array-setter A))) ... (A! obj k1 ...) ...)</code> or <code>(array-set! A obj k1 ...)</code></dd></dl>
    <p>At the same time, this SRFI has some special features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Intervals, used as the domains of arrays in this SRFI, are useful
        objects in their own rights, with their own procedures.  We make a sharp distinction between the domains
        of arrays and the arrays themselves.</li>
      <li>Intervals can have nonzero lower bounds in each dimension.</li>
      <li>Intervals cannot be empty.</li>
      <li>Arrays must have a getter, but may have no setter.</li>
      <li>There are many predefined array transformations: <code>array-extract</code>, <code>array-tile</code>, <code>array-translate</code>, <code>array-permute</code>, <code>array-rotate</code>, <code>array-sample</code>, <code>array-reverse</code>.</li></ul>
    <h2>Other examples</h2>
    <p>Image processing applications provided significant motivation for this SRFI.</p>
    <p><b>Manipulating images in PGM format. </b>On a system with eight-bit chars, one
      can write routines to read and write greyscale images in the PGM format of the netpbm package as follows.  The  lexicographical

    <p>You can see that with differences in the direction of only the first coordinate, the domains of the difference arrays get smaller in the first coordinate while staying the same in the second coordinate, and with differences in the diagonal directions, the domains of the difference arrays get smaller in both coordinates.</p>
    <p><b>Separable operators. </b>Many multi-dimensional transforms in signal processing are <i>separable</i>, in that the multi-dimensional transform can be computed by applying one-dimensional transforms in each of the coordinate directions.  Examples of such transforms include the Fast Fourier Transform and the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.1944">Fast Hyperbolic Wavelet Transform</a>.  Each one-dimensional subdomain of the complete domain is called a <i>pencil</i>, and the same one-dimensional transform is applied to all pencils in a given direction. Given the one-dimensional array transform, one can define the multidimensional transform as follows:</p>
    <pre><code>
(define (make-separable-transform 1D-transform)
  (lambda (a)
    (let ((n (array-dimension a)))
      (do ((d 0 (fx+ d 1)))
          ((fx= d n))
        (array-for-each
         1D-transform
         (array-curry (array-rotate a d) 1))))))
</code></pre>
    <p>Here we have cycled through all rotations, putting each axis in turn at the end, and then applied <code>1D-transform</code> to each of the pencils along that axis.</p>
    <p>Wavelet transforms in particular are calculated by recursively applying a transform to an array and then downsampling the array; the inverse transform recursively downsamples and then applies a transform.  So we define the following primitives: </p>
    <pre><code>
(define (recursively-apply-transform-and-downsample transform)

For example, if $$A=\begin{pmatrix} a_{11}&amp;a_{12}&amp;a_{13}\\ a_{21}&amp;a_{22}&amp;a_{23}\\ a_{31}&amp;a_{32}&amp;a_{33}\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} 1&amp;0&amp;0\\ \ell_{21}&amp;1&amp;0\\ \ell_{31}&amp;\ell_{32}&amp;1\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} u_{11}&amp;u_{12}&amp;u_{13}\\ 0&amp;u_{22}&amp;u_{23}\\ 0&amp;0&amp;u_{33}\end{pmatrix}$$ then $A$ is overwritten with
      $$
      \begin{pmatrix} u_{11}&amp;u_{12}&amp;u_{13}\\ \ell_{21}&amp;u_{22}&amp;u_{23}\\ \ell_{31}&amp;\ell_{32}&amp;u_{33}\end{pmatrix}.
      $$
